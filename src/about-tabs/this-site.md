#### This Site

This site is built using TypeScript with React + Vite. The cool Windows 98
styling is from [98.css](https://github.com/jdan/98.css) with some
overrides in this site's CSS to make the styling more suited for my
purposes. You can find the source for this site on
[GitHub](https://github.com/Roocatt/roocatt.github.io) if you're
curious.

Several bits of writing (including this one) are done using Markdown, and
React plugins to automatically load and build HTML from those Markdown
documents.

The image used on the main page is from a game asset bundle under
the Creative Commons Zero (CC0) licence, and was created by Luis
Zuno (aka Ansimuz). See their [itch.io](https://ansimuz.itch.io/)
page for more from them.

But, Roos, why did you make your site look like an almost 30 year old
operating system that came out when you were 2 years old?
```

Why not? I thought it was cool and fun idea, and I just love the retro
computer aesthetic. I started using computers very young so there's
definitely a nostalgia there for me. As for why Windows 98 in particular:
I grew up mostly with beige machines with PowerPC CPUs running classic
macOS around more so than Windows, but the Windows 98 styling is going to be
more recognizable to most people and I found a fantastic Windows 98 CSS
library.
