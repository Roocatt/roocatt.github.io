#### Professional

Professionally, I am known for my versatility. I have worked a
wide range of roles from backend, to frontend, to systems
administration, to infrastructure, to Salesforce development. Most
of my career has been spent at non-profits, specifically in the
DNS space.

##### Software Work

My software development experience features backend, frontend,
full-stack, building low-level network daemons, and more. I have
worked with Java, Ruby, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Shell,
Perl, C/C++, and PHP to name a few programming languages. That's
before even starting to list frameworks that I have experience
with like Spring and Play with Java, or Rails and Sinatra with
Ruby, or Angular, React, and Vue with TypeScript/JavaScript, or
Kore with C.

##### Infrastructure Work

In addition to developing software, I have also spent much of my
career building and maintaining infrastructure. In this capacity I
have lead automation efforts, and worked on both architecting new
infrastructure as well modernized old infrastructure. I have often
been tasked with ensuring the security of systems including
deploying HSMs or auditing systems.
