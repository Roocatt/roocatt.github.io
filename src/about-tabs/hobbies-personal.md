#### Hobbies and Personal

Well, a first bit of info is a dislike talking about myself and I
do not find it easy to figure out what to say. I am a
:canada:Canadian from a :netherlands:Dutch family, and I grew up
in Ottawa. After a few years elsewhere, I have moved back to
Ontario, and I am living in a cute little house in the woods with
my wife, as well as two cats and a Dog. Also, as per the
aforementioned wife, I am a proud :rainbow_flag:queer woman and
I try to attend and support LGBTQ+ events whenever I can. I am
fluent in English (it is my first language), but I also have
varying degrees of proficiency in Swedish, French, and Dutch.

I love working on tech projects, even when I'm not doing it as part
of my job. When it comes to personal projects, I do a lot of C/C++
development such as with my projects like
[Roos's GPS Tool Kit](https://github.com/Roocatt/rgpstk) or
[piMCP2515](https://github.com/Roocatt/piMCP2515). I always enjoy
building cool things with microcontrollers, and doing anything
with embedded development. Sometimes I also work on building tools
to make my day job easier or to experiment with new technologies
that I haven't had a chance to use yet.

Other than tech, I am a huge fan or racing and motor sport. I am
an avid fan of rally racing, both driving and watching. I follow
the WRC, and I make sure to watch every rally stage, even if just
a replay due to the timing. I have a few vintage Porsche's that I
am currently or have already restored. When it's time to relax
after a long day of work, you'll often find me with a wrench.

I'm also a huge music lover and I have been playing guitar for
most of my life. I listen to a lot of progressive metal (Dream
Theater, Seventh Wonder, Protest the Hero, etc.) and I even used
to play guitar in a prog-metal back in high school. I am also a
fan of jazz (particularly bebop like Charlie Parker, and Charles
Mingus), and I definitely love my girlie-pop too!
